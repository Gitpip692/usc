# prompt: # Deploy USDT (Jetton) on TON and Send to Wallet
# ## Prerequisites
# - [toncli](https://github.com/disintar/toncli) installed (`pip install toncli`)
# - TON wallet address with some TON for fees
# - [token-contracts](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/token-contracts) cloned locally
# ## Steps
# ### 1. Clone Official Jetton Contracts
# ```bash
# git clone https://github.com/ton-blockchain/token-contracts.git
# cd token-contracts/jetton
# ```
# ### 2. Initialize TON Project (if not already)
# ```bash
# toncli init usdt-jetton
# cd usdt-jetton
# toncli install
# ```
# ### 3. Copy Jetton Contracts
# Copy `JettonRoot.fc` and `JettonWallet.fc` from the official repo into your `contracts/` directory.
# ### 4. Prepare Deployment Script
# Paste the following script in your project directory as `deploy_usdt.sh`:
# ```bash
# #!/bin/bash
# # USDT Jetton deployment for TON
# # Set variables
# OWNER="UQCSgPQN7gvW3qOcLmvzCU-Y7WQw-J1ojO3CX_cfAbwPC_0X"
# TOTAL_SUPPLY=1000000000000  # 1,000,000 USDT with 6 decimals
# # Build contracts (if not built)
# toncli build
# # Deploy Jetton Root (replace <YOUR_WALLET> with your deployer wallet address)
# toncli deploy JettonRoot -a $OWNER -s $TOTAL_SUPPLY --symbol USDT --name USDT --decimals 6
# ```
# Make the script executable:
# ```bash
# chmod +x deploy_usdt.sh
# ```
# ### 5. Run the Deployment Script
# ```bash
# ./deploy_usdt.sh
# ```
# > This will deploy a USDT Jetton contract on TON with a total supply of 1,000,000 tokens (6 decimals) and send the full supply to the user's wallet:  
# > `UQCSgPQN7gvW3qOcLmvzCU-Y7WQw-J1ojO3CX_cfAbwPC_0X`

# The provided markdown describes steps for deploying a Jetton on TON.
# This is not directly executable Python code within a Colab notebook.
# To execute shell commands in Colab, prefix them with '!'.

# The provided markdown is not Python code and cannot be directly executed.
# If you want to run these shell commands, you would need to execute them
# line by line in Colab cells, prefixed with '!'.

# Example of how you would run one of the commands:
# !git clone https://github.com/ton-blockchain/token-contracts.git
# !cd token-contracts/jetton  # This will change the directory for the current cell
# Note: Directory changes with `!cd` are not persistent across cells.
# To maintain directory context, use the `%cd` magic command or combine commands.

# Example combining commands to maintain directory:
# !git clone https://github.com/ton-blockchain/token-contracts.git && cd token-contracts/jetton && toncli init usdt-jetton

# The Python code provided in the previous cell is general Colab introductory content
# and not related to the TON deployment task.
# No new Python code is generated as the task describes shell commands.
